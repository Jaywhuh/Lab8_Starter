# Lab 8 - Starter
*Question 1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.*

1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
2. Manually run them locally before pushing code
3. Run them all after all development is completed

Answer: I would fit my automated tests in my Recipe project within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed because you can make github actions run automated tests everytime code  is pushed into the Github repository.

*Question 2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)*

Answer: No I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output because an end to end test is supposed to emulate user actions in order to determine if the program runs smoothly. Unit Testing would be much for suitable to check if a function is return the correct output or not.
